## CoDeCPH Post Conference Blogpost

**The Continuous Delivery & DevOps conference was held on October 22nd, 2014 in the heart of Copenhagen organized by Praqma together with co-host CA technologies and XebiaLabs, Atlassian & QACube as participating sponsors. The Marriott Hotel Copenhagen made for the conference venue for the 200 attendees who were gathered to gain insight on the current trends of Continuous Delivery & DevOps.**

#### CoDeCPH 2014

With two parallel tracks the program was designed so that the keynote speakers took the main stage in front of all attendees and presentations were run on two tracks, giving attendees the freedom to pick and choose the presentations of interest. The program ended with a final panel discussion, where the entire speaker roster took stage to elaborate on their statements as well as allowing attendees to get any questions arisen through the day answered.

Andi Mann from CA Technologies presented the initial Keynote speak on the effectiveness of Cloud Computing and how to understand DevOps as a modern term in the development environment congregating Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing (CAMS). Interaction between CAMS is crucial in order to achieve collaboration between Development and Operations as well as accelerate the release of new capabilities.

#### The need for Continuous Delivery
Throughout the day, speakers shared different perspective on topics closely related to Continuous Delivery and DevOps. Some had a more theoretical approach while others presented “tales from the trenches” approaching both the different organizational as well as technical challenges in global corporations as well as smaller setups. However, common for all was the increasing need for Continuous Delivery and DevOps.

#### So why do we need continuous delivery and DevOps?
With his closing keynote speak "Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use” Jan Bosch sought to answer this question making two interesting main points; (1) Customers do not know what they want and (2) all products will eventually become services.

His point; since customers don’t know what’s possible, they do not know what they want. Thus, one can’t simply ask a large group of people what they want and then make it. Customers will know once they see it - this requires "Need for Speed" (as Bosch put it). This means Continuous Development of product, which he also argues requires DevOps.
Bosch' second point stated that all products will eventually become services, just like many software systems are today. This will require a setup that allows products to be continuously developed throughout its lifetime.

#### CoDe’s "State of the union"
As a concept Continuous Delivery has matured notably and there seems to be consensus about the different levels of maturity. Per Arnold Blaasmo from Atmel presented the various stages of Continuous X maturity with this illustration forecasting that Continuous Delivery has not matured to its fullest and that we’ll se development be taken even further in the future.

Although the concept Continuous Delivery tends to be somewhat clear, the way companies implement, utilise, and to what extend benefit from it, still differs. While some companies represented at the conference had already implemented and benefited from the use of Continuous Delivery other companies were still not reaping the benefits or hadn't even started implementing the Continuous Delivery mindset.

Lars Kruse from Praqma shared insights on the topic by presenting Praqma’s Continuous Delivery Maturity Model and the extensive knowledge the company has gathered through its work. This was supported by some real-life success stories of Continuous Delivery implementations. It was also demonstrated how a team or company's ability to continuously deliver working software requires a certain level of maturity in software development processes.

#### CoDe & CoDeCPH 2015
All in all we were very pleased with the conference and hope to see even more at next year’s conference! Additionally, we are planning various CoDe Meetups throughout the year - so join the CoDe group to be the first to know about any activities.
