##This event is relevant to:
IT executives & managers, software architects & developers, project managers, agile coaches, system administrators - and everyone who's got DevOps at heart.

<span style="background:#4b4b4b; color:#FFFFFF; padding:2px;">Whether you're already deep into CoDe</span> or you're just scratching the surface and want to understand the role of Continuous Delivery, and DevOps in achieving the goals of agility, built-in-quality and time-to-market in software development - `CoDe` is for YOU.

Continuous Delivery and DevOps are all about implementing the agile principles for real: _"implement your definition of done"_. How did you do it? How did others do it? What are best practices? Meet-up with peers for new experiences, knowledge sharing, networking and inspiring speaks that cover all of the multi-faceted area of `CoDe`.
